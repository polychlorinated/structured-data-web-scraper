# JavaScript PuppeteerCrawler Actor template

This template is a production ready boilerplate for developing with `PuppeteerCrawler`. The `PuppeteerCrawler` provides a simple framework for parallel crawling of web pages using headless Chrome with Puppeteer. Since `PuppeteerCrawler` uses headless Chrome to download web pages and extract data, it is useful for crawling of websites that require to execute JavaScript.

## Included features

- **[Puppeteer Crawler](https://crawlee.dev/api/puppeteer-crawler/class/PuppeteerCrawler)** - simple framework for parallel crawling of web pages using headless Chrome with Puppeteer
- **[Configurable Proxy](https://crawlee.dev/docs/guides/proxy-management#proxy-configuration)** - tool for working around IP blocking
- **[Input schema](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/input-schema)** - define and easily validate a schema for your Actor's input
- **[Dataset](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js/docs/guides/result-storage#dataset)** - store structured data where each object stored has the same attributes
- **[Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/api/client/js/)** - toolkit for building Actors

## How it works

1. `Actor.getInput()` gets the input from `INPUT.json` where the start urls are defined
2.  Create a configuration for proxy servers to be used during the crawling with `Actor.createProxyConfiguration()` to work around IP blocking. Use Apify Proxy or your own Proxy URLs provided and rotated according to the configuration. You can read more about proxy configuration [here](https://crawlee.dev/api/core/class/ProxyConfiguration).
3. Create an instance of Crawlee's Puppeteer Crawler with `new PuppeteerCrawler()`. You can pass [options](https://crawlee.dev/api/puppeteer-crawler/interface/PuppeteerCrawlerOptions) to the crawler constructor as:
    - `proxyConfiguration` - provide the proxy configuration to the crawler
    - `requestHandler` - handle each request with custom router defined in the `routes.js` file.
4. Handle requests with the custom router from `routes.js` file. Read more about custom routing for the Cheerio Crawler [here](https://crawlee.dev/api/puppeteer-crawler/function/createPuppeteerRouter)
    - Create a new router instance with `new createPuppeteerRouter()`
    - Define default handler that will be called for all URLs that are not handled by other handlers by adding `router.addDefaultHandler(() => { ... })`
    - Define additional handlers - here you can add your own handling of the page
        ```javascript
        router.addHandler('detail', async ({ request, page, log }) => {
            const title = await page.title();
            // You can add your own page handling here

            await Dataset.pushData({
                url: request.loadedUrl,
                title,
            });
        });
        ```
5. `crawler.run(startUrls);` start the crawler and wait for its finish

## Getting started

For complete information [see this article](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development#build-actor-at-apify-console). In short, you will:

1. Build the Actor
2. Run the Actor

## Pull the Actor for local development

If you would like to develop locally, you can pull the existing Actor from Apify console using Apify CLI:

1. Install `apify-cli`

    **Using Homebrew**

    ```bash
    brew install apify-cli
    ```

    **Using NPM**

    ```bash
    npm -g install apify-cli
    ```

2. Pull the Actor by its unique `<ActorId>`, which is one of the following:
    - unique name of the Actor to pull (e.g. "apify/hello-world")
    - or ID of the Actor to pull (e.g. "E2jjCZBezvAZnX8Rb")

    You can find both by clicking on the Actor title at the top of the page, which will open a modal containing both Actor unique name and Actor ID.

    This command will copy the Actor into the current directory on your local machine.

    ```bash
    apify pull <ActorId>
    ```
